* Store Listing Changes *
- Updated the asset title to remove the "(CG)" characters after the asset name. This has been replaced with "| CG" instead to look a little neater.
- Updated the main asset description to explain more about the asset and its features. 
- Updated all links to be correct for the asset.
- Updated to key images to all be the same size as the main key image.

* Asset Changes *
+ Updated the header comment on the script
+ Updated the layout of the code to be cleaner
+ Added a menu item to show a "2D" view, which just reduced the opacity of the transform elements commonly not used in 2D game development.
